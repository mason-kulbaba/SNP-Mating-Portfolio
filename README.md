Sequence data to accompany the manuscript "A SNP-based approach to estimating the mating and relatedness components of plant mating portfolios" by Mason W. Kulbaba and Lawrence D. Harder. Sequences were obtained through genotyping-by-sequencing as described in the manuscript. The sequences reported here were used to design markers reported in Table 1 of the manuscript. 

The first line of each entry is the name of each SNP-SCALE locus, followed by the sequence that the locus was designed from. The bi-allelic variable nucleotides are indicted with capital letters and separated by a "/".

cstacks pipeline is available at https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/cstacks.php, with specific parameter settings available in the manuscirpt.
